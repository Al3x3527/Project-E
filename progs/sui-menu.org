#+title: Sui Menu
Documenting work done on SUI menu branch.
* Colors
** Notes
*** Code
the color vectors lines 1-9 in m_menu.qc range from 0-1. this is a color model called "RGB 0-1".
+ _BG means background
+ the _DARK color is half the regular background color
+ the background border color = regular color + 0.1
+ the button border color = button color + 0.5
+ the button color = menu border color+
+ the color passed into sui_text for "Title Screen" is [1,1,1]
*** Behavior
+ defualt code opens a black screen with pale orange text (consolas)
+ other menus have white text
+ this is not the intended behavior of the mod. this must be a fallback mode built-in to FTEQW.
+ initiallizing "Project Enoch" just leaves you at the console.
+ the menu.dat file was missing. behavior now reflects code.
** Changing the text color
*** MENU_TEXT_1
+ changed menu text 1 to [0.75 1 0.75] for a green tint.
+ this re-colors the button text.
** text content
*** main_menu
+ changed "Title Screen" to "Project Enoch" (line 256)
+ this worked as expected.
+ changed color of title from white to green.
+ this worked as expected.
* Basic functionality
+ pulling up the console does not work with SUI QC active
+ starting the game does not work with SUI QC active
+ FIX: all SUI related assets must be in the mod folder, not the base engine folder or elsewhere.
